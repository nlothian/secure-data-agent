This app uses Gemma 4 to demonstrate how AI agents work, end to end.

It is a fully functional, fully private agent environment running entirely in your browser, so feel free to experiment.

Key features:
- **Local inference** — Gemma runs on your GPU via transformers.js (ONNX Runtime on WebGPU). The model is a one-off download from Hugging Face, cached by your browser for later visits.
- **Tool use** — run Python (via Pyodide), SQL (via DuckDB), and React, all in the browser.
- **Data loading** — load CSV or Parquet files from a sandboxed local folder (via the HTML5 File System Access API) or from remote servers (via DuckDB).
- **Context management** — local models have a smaller context window, so the app manages it carefully using sub-agents and compaction.
- **Self-explaining code** — the app ships with its own source code, so the built-in AI explainer can show you how any part of it works.

This tour walks through these features and takes about 5 minutes, depending on your hardware.
