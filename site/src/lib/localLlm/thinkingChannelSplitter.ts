/**
 * Streaming splitter that separates Gemma's reasoning ("thought") channel from
 * its body output. Gemma emits a thought channel via the literal markers
 *   `<|channel>thought\n` ... `<channel|>`
 * and we deliberately match only that exact open marker — `<|channel>other\n`
 * etc. is treated as plain body text.
 *
 * In `outside` mode we also recognise a bare `<channel|>` and report it as a
 * `stray-close` event instead of body text. The model sometimes emits
 * reasoning + a stray close marker even when the prompt's thought channel was
 * already closed (thinking disabled); the leading prose comes through as
 * plain body, the tag must not leak into the rendered message, but the
 * caller still needs to know it was there so the model's output can be
 * replayed byte-for-byte (KV-cache reuse depends on an exact replay).
 *
 * The splitter returns an ordered list of events per feed so the caller can
 * faithfully reconstruct the original sequence (multiple opens/closes within
 * a single feed are interleaved correctly with body and thought chunks).
 *
 * Trailing chars that could grow into a marker are held back in `state.buffer`
 * so we never emit half a tag. `flushSplitter` drains whatever is left when
 * the stream ends.
